## Documentation

###Picturefill

**Responsive and high-res images for Wordpress**

- A modified version of Picturefill v1 is used. For more Infos see bower.json
- Version 1.x instead of 2.x is used. Version 2.x is still in Beta, 
and high-res images do not work across mayor browsers. For no-js degradation, Picturefill 2.x only shows ALT text, where 1.x shows an image fallback

Configure: Define image sizes and media queries in inc/wp-theme.php. The filter in inc/wp-hooks.php does the rest.
